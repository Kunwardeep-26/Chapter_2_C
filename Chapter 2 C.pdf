Chapter 2: Instructions and Operators:
A C-program is a set of instructions. Just like a recipe - which contains 
instructions to prepare a particular dish.

Types of instructions:
1.Type declaration instruction

2. Arithmetic instruction

3.Control instruction

Type of declaration instruction:
1. Arithmetic Instructions
Note:

a.No operator is assumed to be present

    int i=ab  ( Invalid )

    int i=a*b  ( valid )

b.There is no operator to perform exponentiation in c however we can 
use pow(x,y) from <math.h>.

2. Type conversion
Operator Precedence in C:-
3*x-8y  is (3x)-(8y) or  3(x-8y)?

In c language, simple mathematical rules like BODMAS no longer applies.

The answer to the above question is provided by operator precedence & associativity.

Operator precedence:-

The following table list the operator priority in C
Priority   Operators
1st  	      * / %
2nd	      +   -
3rd		=
Operators of higher priority are evaluated first in the absence of 
parenthesis.

Operator associativity:-

When operators of equal priority are present in an expression, the
tie is taken care of by associativity

 x  *  y  /  z  =>  (x *  y) / z

x  /  y  *  z  =>  (x / y) * z

*, / follows left to right associativity.

Control instructions
Determines the flow of control in a program.

Four types of control instruction in C are:

1. Sequence Control Instruction

2. Decision Control Instruction

3. Loop Control Instruction

4. Case-Control Instruction
